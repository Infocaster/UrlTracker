The URL Tracker is used to manage URLs within umbraco. It automatically tracks URL changes, for instance when a node is renamed, and makes sure the old URL will redirect to the new location. This is great for SEO and great for people visiting your website via this old URL. Search engines will update the indexed URL and people won't visit the old, broken URL.<br />
You can also create your own redirects, based on a simple URL or using a Regex pattern. You can redirect to an existing node or a manually entered URL. This is great for migrating existing indexed URLs to your new website!

## Umbraco 7.3.0 - 7.3.5 ##
**Umbraco 7.3.0 - 7.3.5** have known issues with the URL Tracker. These are resolved in Umbraco 7.3.6 and 7.4, so please don't use 7.3.0 - 7.3.5 in combination with the URL Tracker.

## Versioning ##
**Version 2** has reached it's end-of-life status and won't be supported anymore. For umbraco versions **4.6 - 6.0** version 2 will remain available as well as the source of v2.  
**Version 3** is the current version and supports umbraco versions **6.1, 7.0, 7.1 and up** if possible. 

## Issues / feature requests ##
If you'd like to report a bug or request a new feature, please use [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/kipusoep/UrlTracker/issues), please don't use Twitter for example, because I won't be able to deal with requests outside Github (will become a mess sooner or later).

## Features ##
*   Keeps track of **URL changes** (node gets renamed, moved or the umbracoUrlName property changes)
*   Keeps track of **not found (404)** requests, so you can easily create redirects for them
*   Keeps track of **removed content** and responds with **410 Gone** when one requests it
*   **Redirects requests** for old URLs to their new location
*   **Create** your own URL redirects, based on a simple URL or a **Regex** pattern. You can redirect to an **existing node** or a manually entered URL.
*   Create **permanent (301)** or **temporary (302)** redirects
*   Supports all extensions, including **.php** and **.html**
*   Supports all kinds of **query string** options, like matching a query string and pass through the request query string
*   Supports **multiple websites** in a single umbraco instance

## Settings ##
The URL Tracker supports a few settings, which you can use in the [appSettings section of your web.config](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa903313(v=vs.71).aspx). Below you'll find these settings, with the type and default value mentioned below the setting name:
### urlTracker:disabled ###
#### boolean (false) ####
Set to true to disable the HTTP Module of the URL Tracker, so it won't redirect requests anymore.
### urlTracker:enableLogging ###
#### boolean (false) ####
Set to true to enable logging debug information of the URL Tracker. Uses umbraco's built-in logging mechanism with LogType set to 'debug'.  
**umbracoDebugMode** needs to be enabled too.
### urlTracker:404UrlsToIgnore ###
#### comma-seperated string (empty) ####
The URL Tracker logs requests resulting in a 404 Not Found status. Some URLs shouldn't be logged and can be set here. One URL is always ignored by default: 'favicon.ico'.  
You can also ignore logging a 404 Not Found entry for certain requests, by adding an HTTP header 'X-UrlTracker-Ignore404' with value '1'
### urlTracker:trackingDisabled ###
#### boolean (false) ####
Set to true to disable tracking URL changes.
### urlTracker:notFoundTrackingDisabled ###
#### boolean (false) ####
Set to true to disable tracking not found (404) requests.
### urlTracker:appendPortNumber ###
#### boolean (true) ####
Set to false to disable appending a port number to redirect URLs
### urlTracker:forcedRedirectCacheTimeoutEnabled ###
#### boolean(false) ####
Set to true to cache forced redirects for a period of time.
Setting this to true will enable forced redirect updates and additions to propagate to all servers in a multi-server environment.
### urlTracker:forcedRedirectCacheTimeoutSeconds ###
#### int (14400) ####
Amount of time, in seconds, that the forced redirects will be cached for. Default is 14400 seconds (4 hours). The default value will be used when the app setting is less than 1.
This setting does nothing unless **urlTracker:forcedRedirectCacheTimeoutEnabled** is true.

## Events ##
You can customise the HttpResponse object from the URL Tracker, should you need to change the status code or other types of output.

The following code sample will detect if we're a 410 response, and if so attempt to render the 404 template as defined in [umbracoSettings](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/reference/config/umbracosettings/#errors). If it fails it will simply return a 404 status code.
This code should be placed within the [Umbraco startup events](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/reference/events/application-startup#application-startup-events-event-registration)
s
```c#
public void OnApplicationStarted(UmbracoApplicationBase umbracoApplication, ApplicationContext applicationContext)
{
	InfoCaster.Umbraco.UrlTracker.Modules.UrlTrackerModule.PreUrlTracker += UrlTrackerModule_PreUrlTracker;

	private void UrlTrackerModule_PreUrlTracker(object sender, HttpResponse e)
	{

		var errorPage = UmbracoConfig.For.UmbracoSettings().Content.Error404Collection.FirstOrDefault();

		if (errorPage != null && errorPage.HasContentId && errorPage.ContentId != 1)
		{
			var template = new UmbracoHelper(UmbracoContext.Current).RenderTemplate(errorPage.ContentId);
			e.Write(template);
		}
		else
		{
			if (e.StatusCode == 410)
			{
				e.StatusCode = 404;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Roadmap ##
*   Datatype
*   Better validation (already existing etc.)
*   Support UrlRewriting if possible
*   Azure support (if it doesn't work yet, untested)

## Upgrading from v1 (301 URL Tracker) ##
1.   Back-up the existing infocaster301 database table (schema **and** data)
2.   Uninstall the old package
3.   When the database table is removed, restore it by using the script from step 1
4.   Install version 2; the URL Tracker
5.   The installation wizard will be able to migrate the existing data
6.   If the migration succeeded, you can delete the old infocaster301 database

## Upgrading from v2 and v3 ##
1.   Optional: Uninstall the old package (no data will be lost, but you might want to do this just to keep the 'Installed packages' clean)
2.   Install the new version

## Uninstalling ##
You can uninstall the URL Tracker by removing the package. The database table will not get deleted! If you'd like to remove the database table too, you should do it manually.

## Tested with ##
*   IIS 7 and up
*   SQL Server 2008 R2
*   .NET 4 and up
*   Version 2: Umbraco versions 4.6.1, 4.7.2, 4.9.1, 4.11.9, 6.0.0, 6.1.1 **(won't work with pre v4.6.0)**, so it should work with umbraco v4.6.0 and above (reports indicate that there are problems with v7)
*   Version 3: Umbraco versions 6.1, 7.0, 7.1 and above if possible

## Credits ##
*   **InfoCaster** | Being able to combine 'work' with package development and thanks to colleagues for inspiration.
*   **Richard Soeteman** | Richard came up with the idea for a package which keeps track of URLs of umbraco nodes.
*   **The uComponents project** | For inspiring me to create a single-assembly package solution.
